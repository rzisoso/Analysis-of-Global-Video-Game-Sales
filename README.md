# Global Video Game Sales: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive case study analyzing a dataset of over 16,500 video games with sales data. The goal is to practice and demonstrate end-to-end data analysis skills using Python and its popular data science libraries. 

The process includes data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to answer key business questions about the video game market.

## Key Findings & Insights

* **Platform Dominance:** The **PlayStation 2 (PS2)** stands as the best-selling platform of all time, highlighting Sony's historical market leadership.
* **Regional Preferences:** A significant difference exists between major markets. North America shows a strong preference for the **Xbox 360**, while Europe favors the **PlayStation 3**, indicating different brand loyalties.
